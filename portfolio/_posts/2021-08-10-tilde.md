aside: At the end of summer 2019, I left my position of Director of Product Design at WD, and ended up working alone at home again. I started to miss the energy of my design team, the clickety of people's keyboard, the chatter. I then discovered that many people, and remote teams, had the same need.

When Covid hit, it was very clear there was a need for connection. This is why I founded With labs, and built [Tilde](https://tilde.so/?ref=io). 

In this prototype I want to highlight a couple of key product explorations.

First, it's a **spatial place**, you can drag and drop your avatar or any accessory wherever you want.

It's audio-first, because for the vast majority of presence, video is not required. This is why we built **talking avatars**, that you can experience if you enable your mic.

Then, it's the idea of **nearby audio**, where you only hear audio that are close to you. You can experiment with that by unmuting the video.

Last, it's the idea of **personalizable space**. Just change the wallpaper, and the interface adapt to it, to give you a cohesive feel. You can try it by changing the wallpaper (*the file is not uploaded anywhere, it's all local*)
