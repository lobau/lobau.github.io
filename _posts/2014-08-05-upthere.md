title: "Upthere"
aside: In 2013, I left Apple to follow Bertrand Serlet in his new startup, [Upthere](https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/29/9632904/upthere-cloud-file-storage-bertrand-serlet). The mission of the company was to build a cloud storage for a lifetime of stuff.

I joined as their lead designer, managing two designers, [Fan Zhang](http://fan.design/) and [Terry Liu](http://tyliu.com).

I got very intrigued by the idea of browsing and searching a lifetime of content in a simple interface. You can see above two examples of this direction.

On the left, Upthere Camera, which allows you to take photos directly to the cloud, without using any physical storage. On top of that, you can take photos in shared albums directly.

One the right, you can see Upthere Home, in which you could scroll through decades of photos very quickly.
