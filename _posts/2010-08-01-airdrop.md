Talk about how it started as a hackathon. Icon with the ripple animations.
One of the biggest issues with having people in the Finder, is making sure they don't look like files. At the time, I was also redesigning the login screen, and I was experimenting with rounded avatars to symbolize people. Steve Jobs really liked the idea and thoughts it would be appropriate to represent people as circle in AirDrop too. Since then, the world has adopted this pattern, and circular avatars are in pretty much every app.
