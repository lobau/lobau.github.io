# About

This is my personal website. You can visit it at [lobau.io](https://lobau.io). You are totally free to use this code to build your own portfolio, or anything else you would like to do with it. However, you are NOT allowed to display, adapt, perform or re-share any of the projects showcased in this portfolio.

## Github Pages
This website uses GitHub page, which is powered by Jekyll. To run it locally you will have to [install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). If you want to host your own website for free on GitHub, just fork this repository and rename it to *username*.github.io. That's it, you have your own website.

## Design constraints
I built this website with some silly constraints, just because I wanted to:
- This website doesn't use any JavaScript
- This website doesn't use CSS classes, only semantic HTML tags. Instead of doing everything with divs, why not look at [this list](https://www.w3schools.com/TAGs/) and see which tags are semantically appropriate for the content? 
- This website only used HTML Named Colors, no hex, no HSL, no RGB. Use [this tool](https://shallowsky.com/colormatch/index.php) if you want to find the nearest matching color
- This website supports light and dark theme
- This website supports all devices
